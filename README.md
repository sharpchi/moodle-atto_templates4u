# moodle-atto_templates

This is an atto plugin for Moodle which allows the administrator to define a set of predefined templates which a teacher can insert into their course pages.

It behaves in a very similar way as the TinyMCE templates function (<https://www.tinymce.com/docs-3x/reference/plugins/Plugin3x@template/>). Rather than storing the templates as stand-alone files, they are stored as settings in Moodle.

## Installing
1.  Drop code into /lib/editor/atto/plugins
2.  Go to Site administration -> Notifications to install
3.  Add as many templates as you like
